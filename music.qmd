  My musical journey with the viola started in 4th grade through the Santa Monica Malibu
  Unified School District (SMMUSD) music program. I began taking lessons in 5th grade 
  under the direction of [Dr. Lindsey Strand-Polyak](https://www.strandpolyak.com/). I 
  have now played the viola for 11 years and music has contributed to so many of my most
  special experiences and memories. Through various fundraiser performances, seasonal 
  concerts, weddings, and tours, I've met incredible people and made life-long
  friends.

  In April 2023, the SAMOHI <a href="https://www.samohiorchestras.org/orchestras" target="_blank">Chamber Orchestra</a>, an
  ensemble made of the first two rows of strings from the Symphony Orchestra toured Ireland, 
  performing in Derry, Belfast, and Dublin. One of my favorite pieces from the program was 
  Elgar's <em>Introduction & Allegro for Strings, Op. 47</em>. The piece was written for a string 
  quartet and accompanying string ensemble. I performed the viola solo in the quartet and 
  had a great time performing with my friends.

  I love playing duets with recordings of myself or digital instruments, and throughout the
  years I've started writing down my compositions. After class and on weekends, I also 
  enjoy learning pop songs with my friends, pianist, Kai Mawhinney, and vocalist and guitarist, [Emmett 
  Levine](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmett-levine/). We often improvise together and have performed on the Claremont College
  student radio, [KSPC](https://kspc.org/), and at Emmett's Guitar Club recitals.
