Through a breadth and depth of hands-on personal projects, I've develop new
and useful skills to broaden my engineering problem solving toolbox. I believe projects and experiments are 
the best way to learn for yourself what works and what doesn't, and adjust as needed to keep
moving foward. My projects bring me great satisfaction and I love putting in the time and effort
to bringing my ideas to life. If they work, wonderful! And if they don't turn out as expected, 
I take what I've learned and quickly and efficiently modify my methods until I reach my goal. 
Check out some of the projects I've worked on so far!

### Digital Stop Watch ###

    I designed a stopwatch-style timer to record elapsed time using an 
    [Arduino UNO R3](documents/Arduino_datasheet.pdf) microcontroller
    and a [5461BS](https://www.xlitx.com/datasheet/5461BS.pdf) 7-segment 4-digit display. 
    The stopwatch was equipped with two buttons: one to play/pause and another to reset the time. 
    I gained practice with programming concepts such as managing states, multiplexing, and debouncing.

    Using a [Teensy 4.0](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/card10a_rev2_web.pdf), I designed a game of Simon Says. A sequence is played on the white LEDs and players must match 
    the order of the sequence with the buttons. An incorrect answers lights the red LED while a correct answer 
    lights the green LED and increases the sequence length by 1. If the final sequence is played correctly, 
    the yellow LED will flash indicating a win.

### Pickleball Paddle ###

    I built a pickleball paddle for the 2025 Machine Shop proctor pickleball tournament! Measurements of
    an actual paddle were taken in order to set the correct dimensions of the sketch on the [ShopBot](https://shopbottools.com/)
    CNC Router. I selected appropriate cutting paths and tab locations to ensure the paddles would 
    be cut safely. After the paddle was cut, it was hand-sanded and painted. A laser cut stencil was used to to create precise lettering.

    I made my own custom pen and learned to safely and effectively operate the wood lathe. The pen started out 
    as a rectangular block of oak wood and using a series of gouges, I evenly rounded out 
    the block's edges. At a slower speed, I applied sandpaper at increasing grits
    to remove small pockets. Lastly, varish was applied to create the final finish. The pen 
    shell and [hardware](https://www.thewoodturningstore.com/pen-making/pen-pencil-kits/) was
    assembled using an arbor press. Thanks [Brayden Hendrick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brayden-hedrick/)
    for your guidance!

### Cheese Knife ###

    For Christmas, I made my family a set of custom utensils. I took inspiration from
    *[Wooden Utensils from the Bandsaw](https://www.rockler.com/wooden-utensils-from-the-bandsaw-paperback-book?)* to 
    make my cheese knife. I started by drawing profiles for each utensil on a sticker, then used the bandsaw to cut out
    the general shape on my piece of wood stock. The belt sanders were used to create smooth curves along the handle of
    each untensil. I then hand-sanded each piece to remove pockets and dunked them in mineral oil to make each utensil food-safe.
