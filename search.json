    "text": "Methods & Design\n\nDevelopment Board Setup\n\nThe development board system was constructed by soldering surface mount technology (SMT) and through hole technology (THT) components. The development boards used for the project were the UPduino v3.1 FPGA and the Nucleo-L432KC MCU which were connected to the board via female header pins. Figure 1 below shows the other components soldered to the board, including: DIP switches, LEDS, resistors, capacitor, voltage regulators, and jumpers to provide power to the FPGA and MCU.\n\n Figure 1: Complete μP Dev Board v4 with all components soldered.\n\n\nTesting FPGA & MCU\n\nBefore proceeding, the FPGA and MCU were individually tested using on-board LED blink code to verify proper hardware function. SMT LEDs and resistors were soldered by hand with a soldering iron, however, applying a heat method could have resulted in a aesthetically cleanear look.\n\n\n\nFPGA Project Overview\n\nAfter hardware verification, the FPGA was programmed to complete the lab tasks: Demonstrate hexademical counting from 0 to F on a 7-segment display and correct LED sequences when DIP switches are selected. Table 1 sourced from the E155 Lab 1 Instructions shows types of signals used for the project. Moreover, led[0] and led[1] were designed according to Table 2 and Table 3, respectively. Notably, led[2] was intended to follow a different sequence.\n\n Table 1: Signal name, type, and brief description for each signal used in the project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSignal Name\nSignal Type\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nclk\ninput\n48MHz clock on FPGA\n\n\ns[3:0]\ninput\nThe 4 DIP switches (SW6)\n\n\nled[2:0]\noutput\n3 LEDS (on-board LEDs)\n\n\nseg[6:0]\noutput\nCommon-anode 7-segment display segments\n\n\n\n Table 2: Expected behavior of led[0].\n\n\n\nS1\nS0\nled[0]\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\nOFF\n\n\n0\n1\nON\n\n\n1\n0\nON\n\n\n1\n1\nOFF\n\n\n\n Table 3: Expected behavior of led[1].\n\n\n\nS3\nS2\nled[1]\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\nOFF\n\n\n0\n1\nOFF\n\n\n1\n0\nOFF\n\n\n1\n1\nON\n\n\n\n Notably, led[2] was set to blink at 2.4Hz. \n\nFor the 7-segment display, each of the four DIP switches should correspond to a bit in the 4-bit binary number that produces hexadecimal characters 0 to F on the display. For example, if the 4-bit DIP switch input is 4'b1010, then the 7-segment display would show A for hexadecimal representation fo decimal 10."

    "text": "Technical Documentation\n\nThe project was contructed using two modules: lab1_DSH.sv and SevenSegment.sv. Figure 2 below shows the block diagram relationship of the modules.\n\n Figure 2: Block diagram showing the relationship between lab1_DSH.sv and SevenSegment.sv.\n\nLED Implementation in lab1_DSH.sv\n\nBy inspection of the LED tables, led[0] is turned ON according to the XOR of inputs s[0] and s[1]. Meanwhile, led[1] is turned ON according to the AND of inputs s[2] and s[3]. In order to generate a blinking frequency of 2.4Hz for led[2], a clock divider was adapted to cycle down the 48MHz on-board HSOSC. First the HSOSC was divided in half using CLKHF_DIV(2'b01) from the HSOSC library. A frequency of 2.4Hz means led[2] cycles blinks every 0.4167 seconds. Since a full ON-OFF or OFF-ON cycle takes two toggles, the updated clock must count every 0.2083 seconds. Thus, 5,000,000 counts of the now 24MHz clock will register one toggle for led[2] to cycle every 0.2803 seconds = 5,000,000 / 24MHz.\n\n\n\n7-Segment Implementation in SevenSegment.sv\n\nThe 7-segment display was designed using combinational logic to map sixteen DIP switch cases to output 0 to F on the display. Since the 7-segment display had a common anode design, pins were driven LOW to light up their respective segments. Figure 3 shows the schematic for how the 7-segment display was wired to the FPGA and the connection to the LEDs and SW6 DIP switches. Furthermore, Figure 4 provides the justification for pull-down resistor values for the 7-segment display.\n\n Figure 3: Schematic showing the wiring of the 7-segment display to the FPGA and DIP switches.\n  Figure 4: Calculations to justify the 7-segment display resistor values."

Figure 5 shows that the top-level lab1_DSH.sv module matches all expectations for LED patterns and 7-segment display values.\n\n  Figure 5: All LED and 7-segment display outcomes matched expectations in Questa.\n\nSince, the WaveSim did not reflect led[2] blinking accuracy, an oscilloscope was used to measure the LED component’s frequency in real-time. Figure 6 verifies that led[2] blinked at a frequency of 2.404Hz.\n\n Figure 6: The blinking frequency of led[2] was confirmed to be 2.404Hz using an oscilloscope."

    "text": "Conclusion & Demo\n\nAll designs were successfuly implemented on the FPGA. All simulations matched expectations and the physical hardware behaved as intended. The lab took a total of 27 hours to complete.\n\n\nThrough this lab, I gained hands-on practice with assembling a development board and testing hardware, programming hardware through SystemVerilog, and interfacing a 7-segment display to the FPGA board. Overall, Lab 1 was a good practice with soldering and a solid introduction to programming with Lattice Radiant.\n\n\nThe most significant issues with the lab were with the lack of materials and inefficient tools. First, there was a shortage of key equipment such as SMT LEDs and ribbon cables. Second, the software itself was very slow to open, often taking 10 minutes to start up. Third, inconsistency of the port connections when connecting the FPGA to the lab computer never worked immediately. Had these external factors been not been an issue, the time to complete the lab might be cut down by a third.\n\n  ▶ Lab 1 FPGA Video  \n\nAI Prototype\nThe purpose of the AI Prototype is to experiment with usign AI as a coding assistant to produce HDL. The following prompt was entered to ChatGPT 5.0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLLM Prompt\n\n\n\nWrite SystemVerilog HDL to leverage the internal high speed oscillator in the Lattice UP5K FPGA and blink an LED at 2 Hz. Take full advantage of SystemVerilog syntax, for example, using logic instead of wire and reg.\n\n\n\nInitially, ChatGPT 5.0 was unable to produce synthasizable code since the the libraries it instatiated were not setup in the Lattice Radiant project. By nudging the LLM with phrases such as ’write a fully functional” and providing it error feedback from Lattice Radiant, the LLM was able to produce synthasizable code by its third iteration.\n\n\nIn terms of speed to produce a solution, the LLM was very fast, producing detailed solutions with comments in seconds. Although the code contained 1-2 errors initially, after very little prompting adjustments, the LLM was able to produce a succinct and accurate code chunk that followed similar logic to the counter divider that was used in this lab.\n\n\nOverall, ChatGPT 5.0’s output is impressive since it was generated nearly instantly, synthasized within a few attempts, and eventually produced a reasonable and detailed solution with surface-level guidance. Moreover, the errors made were not forseeable given the original prompting context. To avoid programming errors in the future when working with LLMs, it is important to provide the full context of your project (e.g. List of installed libraries)."

    "text": "Technical Documentation\n\nThe project was contructued using two modules: lab2_dsh.sv and sevensegment.sv. In addition, the HSOSC library was reused to generate a system counter to toggle between powering each side of the display. Figure 2 shows SystemVerilog module hierarchy block diagram.\n\n Figure 2: Block diagram representation of SystemVerilog module hierarchy.\n\nMultiplexing Implentation in lab1_dsh.sv\n\nGiven fewer FPGA I/O pins than pins on the dual 7-segment display, a multiplexer was used to select which switch input should be fed into the 7-segment display at a given time. The signal to toggle the multiplexer was the internal variable state was a slowed down version of the HSOSC clock native to the board. In order to synchronize the multiplexing of the switch inputs with their visual numbers on the display, state was directly set to toggle output variables select and notselect which correspond to powering the left and right common anodes of the dual 7-segment display, respectively. Importatnly, state was set to toggle at at a frequency of 240Hz means a given display side flashes 120 per second—a rate faster than the human eye can detect which ensured seamless appearance.\n\n\n\nAdding Implentation in lab1_dsh.sv\n\nA simple adder was used to determine the sum of the DIP switch values. The sum was stored in the output variable led and bit LED was assigned a bit such that the sequence would correctly display the sum in binary.\n\n\n\n7-Segment Implementation in sevensegment.sv\n\nIdentical to Lab 1, the 7-segment display was designed using combinational logic to map all quad DIP switch cases to output number 0 to F on the display. Furthermore, Figure 3 shows the schematic for how the two DIP switches, dual 7-segment display, PNP transistor, and five LEDs were wired to the FPGA. Furthermore, Figure 4 provides justification for all current limiting resistors since the FPGA can sustain a maximum current of 8mA.\n\n Figure 3: Schematic showing the wiring of all componts to the FPGA.\n Figure 4: Calculations to justify current limiting resistor values through the PNP transistor base, green LEDs, and dual 7-segment display."

    "text": "Conclusion & Demo\n\nAll designs were successfully implemented. All simulations matched expectation and the physical hardware behaved as intended. The lab took 14 hours to complete.\n\n\nBeyond reinforcing concepts of time-multiplexing to overcome challenges with limited hardware, I also gained valuable practice with hardware-aware digital design. That is, I learned how to integrate PNP transistors to source current common-anode displays, calculate and justify current-limiting resistor values using datasheets, and synchronize a divided oscillator signal with human perception to achieve a smooth visual output. This lab also strengthened my workflow of simulating modules in Questa prior to hardware implementation, which helped ensure correctness and streamline debugging.\n\n  ▶ Lab 2: Multiplexing Video  \n\nAI Prototype\nThe purpose of the AI Prototype is to experiment with usign AI as a coding assistant to produce HDL. The following prompt was entered to ChatGPT 5.0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLLM Prompt\n\n\n\nWrite SystemVerilog HDL to time multiplex a single seven segment decoder (that decodes from four bits to a common anode seven segment display) to decode two sets of input bits and drive two sets of seven output bits.\n\n\n\nWithin 10 seconds of thinking, ChatGPT 5.0 produced a SystemVerilog script that was capable of being synthesized in Lattice Radiant on the first try. Figure 7 below shows the RTL schematic of the generated script. Looking at the schematic, the number of inputs matches expectations as there are two 4-bit inputs, clk, and reset. In terms of outputs, the schematic correctly shows two sets of 7-segment displays as well as toggle bits held in anode[1:0], however, there is an extra set of outputs called seg_bus[6:0] which appears to acts a docking location for the display value before it is output on seg[0] or seg[1]. Nevertheless, seg_bus[6:0] should be an internal variable not an output.\n\n Figure 7: RLT schematic of the SystemVerilog script produced by ChatGPT 5.0.\n\nWithin the same AI conversation with the LLM, the following follow-up prompt was asked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLLM Prompt\n\n\n\nWrite SystemVerilog HDL to time multiplex a single seven segment decoder (that decodes from four bits to a common anode seven segment display) to decode two sets of input bits and drive two sets of seven output bits. Use the seven segment decoder and oscillator provided in the attached files.\n\n\n\nFor some reason, when sharing my Lab 1 files with ChatGPT, it was unable to produce a script capable of being synthesized in Lattice Radiant. I prompted the LLM three times, encouraging it to implement insights from the attached documents and it was never able to correctly do so."
