    "text": "At Harvey Mudd, the General Engineering major is highly robust. Our program consists of three main approaches to tackling Engineering: Systems, Sciences, and Design. The Systems appraoch focuses on how to apply mathematically model general system outputs and functions of their input. The Sciences are intended to give a broad education in engineering, where students explore Chemical and Thermal Processes, Mechanics, Electronic and Magnet Circuits, Computer Architecture, and Material Science. Lastly, the Design field teaches Professional skills necessary to apply theory learned in class. These skills include, teamwork, communication, project management, and design and prototyping. During my time at Mudd, I’ve worked on a variety of interesting projects to complete practical tasks. Below, I’ve listed a few of my favorite Engineering class projects.\nBy clicking the  Show More  buttons below, learn more about the What, How, and Results of each project."
