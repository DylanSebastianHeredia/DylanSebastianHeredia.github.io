    "text": "At Harvey Mudd, the General Engineering major is highly robust. Our program consists of three main approaches to tackling Engineering: Systems, Sciences, and Design. The Systems appraoch focuses on how to apply mathematically model general system outputs and functions of their input. The Sciences are intended to give a broad education in engineering, where students explore Chemical and Thermal Processes, Mechanics, Electronic and Magnet Circuits, Computer Architecture, and Material Science. Lastly, the Design field teaches Professional skills necessary to apply theory learned in class. These skills include, teamwork, communication, project management, and design and prototyping. During my time at Mudd, I’ve worked on a variety of interesting projects to complete practical tasks. Below, I’ve listed a few of my favorite Engineering class projects.\nBy clicking the  Show More  buttons below, learn more about the What, How, and Results of each project."

I selected appropriate cutting paths and tab locations to ensure the paddles would be cut safely. After the paddle was cut, it was hand-sanded and painted.

The pen started out as a rectangular block of oak wood and using a series of gouges, I evenly rounded out the block’s edges. At a slower speed, I applied sandpaper at increasing grits to remove small pockets. Lastly, varish was applied to create the final finish. The pen shell and hardware was assembled using an arbor press.

I took inspiration from Wooden Utensils from the Bandsaw to make my cheese knife. I started by drawing profiles for each utensil on a sticker, then used the bandsaw to cut out the general shape on my piece of wood stock. The belt sanders were used to create smooth curves along the handle of each untensil. I then hand-sanded each piece to remove pockets and dunked them in mineral oil to make each utensil food-safe."

I’m passionate about working at the intersection of hardware and systems that sense, respond, and interact in the world. I thrive in hands-on, fast paced environments and seek technical opportunities that will allow me to deepen my engineering skills and contribute to meaningful, systems-driven projects.\nOutside of engineering, I’m drawn to visual and audio storytelling in the form of photography, sketching, and editing sound and video. These hobbies sharpen my attention to detail, structure, and rhythm, which contribute to how I approach engineering problems. Whether I’m designing an electrical system, writing embedded code, or building a website—like the one I created here using Quarto x GitHub—I focus on how components work together and how the system behaves as a whole.
