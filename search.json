We are an inclusive, gender expansive team and hold trainings three times a week for 2-hours to practice gameplay, strategy, and have a good time. Last season, we represented the South West region at the Men’s Division-III Nationals 2024 in Milwaukee, earning the Team Spirit Award for outstanding knownledge of the game and sportsmanship. I’ve made countless memories with the team both on and off field, and I’m excited to see where we go this season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeam photo of the Braineaters at USA Ultimate Division-III Mens Nationals 2024."

The student Machine Shop is a fundamental resource to many student projects and experiences across the Claremont Colleges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow More\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll Harvey Mudd students in E4 manufacture identical machinist hammers by following specific process routers and tolerances listed in tech drawings.\nCrafted a machinist hammer from clear oak, AISI 1015 steel, AISI 4340 steel, and nylon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMachined head stock to length and specification using lathe and milling operations.\nHeat treated hardface and determined HRC Hardness.\nLasercut hammer stand and shaped handle using the bandsaw and spindle sander.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreated a functional hammer with heat treated hard face, well fastened soft face, and smooth handle finish.\nHammer is durable and approved as high quality of manufacturing.\nInspired to become a machine shop proctor and train new users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimization of Neuroimaging Apparatus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Burns at Pomona College uses functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) to monitor brain activity by measuring how infrared light (IR) interacts with oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) in the brain. A significant challenge arises when using fNIRS with individuals who have thick or darker hair, as the hair can block the IR light from properly reaching the scalp. With my team—Annette Chang, Brock Bownds, and Gabrielle Reynolds, we sought to develop methods to effectively direct IR light from fNIRS devices to the scalp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow More\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloped and selected three design alternatives:\n\n\nFiber Optic Attachment with Custom Spring Cap threads IR light through thick hair to the scalp.\nHair Moving Pick moves hair away from covering the scalp.\nWider Mounting Base enables more pressure between the scalp and optodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMachined prototypes to verify proof of concept and refined iterations based on client input and professor feedback.\nDeveloped comprehen- sive process routers for all prototype designs and documented findings into reports to be shared with the team and the client.\nFostered a welcoming and collaborative environment for all team members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImproved signal clarity of fNIR device for users with dense hair types (3C, 4A), improving readings from critical to acceptable.\nGained experience arranging and executing client meetings to determine project objectives, constraint, functions, and means.\nApplied principles of engineering design and team dynamics to a real-world project."
