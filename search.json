First the HSOSC was divided in half using CLKHF_DIV(2'b01) from the HSOSC library. A frequency of 2.4Hz means led[2] cycles blinks every 0.4167 seconds. Since a full ON-OFF or OFF-ON cycle takes two toggles, the updated clock must count every 0.2083 seconds.

    "text": "Methods & Design\n\nLab Overview\n\nThe goals of the lab were twofold: 1) Build a circuit to enable an I/O pin from the MCU to drive a speaker and 2) Write libraries in C from scratch. To meet the outlined goals, two timers were developed. First, timer TIM15 was used to generate precise millisecond delays for note durations. Second, timer TIM16 was used to produce PWM signals corresponding to musical notes. The GPIO pin PA6 was configured to use alternate function 14 so that the TIM16 output could be routed to the audio circuit. Then, the main program iterated through arrays containing note frequencies (Hz) and durations (ms), updating the PWM output for each note and delaying the program execution according to the specified note length. This setup allowed the MCU to function as a digital audio synthesizer capable of playing sequences of notes with varying pitches.\n\n Figure 1: Physical circuit setup for MCU, potentiometer, and speaker components.\n\nCustom headers were written for the RCC, GPIO, and TIM modules to allow direct access to registers and bit manipulation. This was necessary to configure clocks, timers, and GPIOs. By defining the timer registers in TIM.h as structured data, specific registers could be modified for PWM output or delay control.\n\n\n\nClock Control\n\nThe system clock, running at 80MHz, was routed through the reset-control clock (RCC) to the timers and GPIO peripherals. The timer TIM16 input clock was scaled down using a prescaler (PSC) of 79 to generate frequency of 1 MHz. The timer TIM15 clock prescaler was set to 3000 to correctly span the full range of delays. Enabling the peripherals and setting prescalers involved setting the appropriate bits in the RCC registers, specifically in AHB2ENR and APB2ENR. The prescaler values were chosen to accommodate the range of frequencies required for musical notes and the range of durations found in the note arrays.\n\n\n\nTimer Setup\n\nTIM15 was configured to generate precise delays corresponding to note durations. Its prescaler scaled the 80MHz system clock down to a practical frequency for millisecond timing. The auto-reload register (ARR) was set based on the desired delay in milliseconds by scaling the system clock, and the program waited for the update interrupt flag before continuing execution. This method allowed accurate timing for each note and enabled simple modificaiton of tempos by modifying the note duration arrays.\n\n\nTIM16 was configured to generate PWM signals for audio output. The prescaler reduced the clock to 1MHz, and the ARR was calculated as the timer clock divided by the note frequency. The capture/compare register CCR1 was set to half of the auto-reload value to produce a square wave with a 50% duty cycle. PWM mode 1 with preload enabled ensured smooth waveform output. The output was routed to PA6 using alternate function 14. Frequency changes were handled dynamically using the setPWM() function, which updated ARR and CCR1 for each note without glitches.\n\n\nThe main program first configured wait states and system clocks, then enabled the necessary GPIO and timer peripherals. TIM16 PWM was initialized with 40 Hz (A4) and the program played Für Elise by iterating through the note arrays, updating TIM16 frequency, and delaying each note with TIM15. After a one-second pause, TIM16 was reinitialized and the program played Blue (Da Ba Dee). Finally, TIM16 was stopped to end the tunes."

This is reasonable to me because I used PA6 to map directly to GPIO pins with alternate function mode.\n\n\nFor Question 3, the LLM provided the formulas shown in Figure 5 below as well as advice on how to configure registers correctly. Both the formulas and register configuration approach are valid.\n\n\n\n Figure 5: LLM response to relevant formula for selecting ARR and PSC."

    "text": "He/Him\nHello! My name is Sebastian and I’m a Junior at Harvey Mudd College majoring in Engineering, with a strong foundation in math and a growing interest in electrical engineering—especially as it connects to embedded systems, robotics, and automation. I’m passionate about working at the intersection of hardware and systems that sense, respond, and interact in the world. I thrive in hands-on, fast paced environments and seek technical opportunities that will allow me to deepen my engineering skills and contribute to meaningful, systems-driven projects.\nOutside of engineering, I’m drawn to visual and audio storytelling in the form of photography, sketching, and editing sound and video. These hobbies sharpen my attention to detail, structure, and rhythm, which contribute to how I approach engineering problems. Whether I’m designing an electrical system, writing embedded code, or building a website—like the one I created here using Quarto x GitHub—I focus on how components work together and how the system behaves as a whole. This perspective allows me to prototype efficiently, communicate ideas clearly, and approach challenges both methodically and creatively.\nOpen Full Resume in New Tab"

    "text": "Background\n\nLab Overview\n\nThis lab consisted of two primary goals. The first goal was to implement an interrupt algorithm to sense quadrature encoder pulses and convert them into motor velocity. The second goal was to display the measured speed with direction to a user with an update rate of at least 1Hz. Moreover, the interrupts were set to trigger on both the rising and falling edges of the encoder pulses to optimize accuracy when determining elapsed time between pulses.\n\n\n\nQuadrature Encoder\n\nA quadrature encoder is an incremental sensor with two or more out-of-phase output channels that can detect the speed and direction of motion of a rotating shaft. Since the channels are offset by 90º as shown in Figure 1, when channel A leads channel B, the motion is clockwise (CW), and when B leads A, the direction is reversed (CCW). In this specific lab, the quadrature encoder measures the angle of the DC brushed motor axle using Hall effect sensors which count pulses in the form of magnetic fields.\n\n Figure 1: Quadrature encoder setup with Hall effect sensors 90º out of phase to determine direction.\n\nAs the motor rotates, the Hall effect sensors will output will register HIGH (1) when passing a fixed point within the motor casing, otherwise they register LOW (0). In this way, a square wave alternating between HIGH and LOW is created for each encoder."

Additionally, the flow of the interrupt design can be visualized in Figure 2 pictured below.\n\n Figure 2: Flowchart illustrating the main loop, setups, and interrupt sequence of the design.\n\nDirection Logic\n\nOnce an interrupt is triggered in compute_velocity, the interrupt handler determines the direction of the motor by comparing the encoder states before the interrupt to the encoder states when the interrupt is triggered by a motor rotation. The handler, EXTI9_5_IQRHandler, determines direction by checking which encoder is “seen” first from a given initial state combination. Since there are two encoders and each encoder can occupy one of two states (HIGH or LOW), there are 2^2 = 4 total state combinations. Figure 3 below shows a visualization of how moving between the four encoder state combinations results in clockwise (CW) motion when ENCODER_A leads versus counter-clockwise (CCW) motion when ENCODER_B leads. For example, if the last state combination is A = 0 and B = 0 and the next state combination is A = 1 and B = 0, then the direction is CW since A is “seen” first and is therefore leading B. Examining this approach more closely, a future design might only check the current state of each encoder since the interrupt actually only fires when the encoder readings change. That is, the current direction does not depend on the previous direction since the interrupt only monitors the current direction.\n\n Figure 3: Visualization of leading and lagging square wave signals between ENCODER_A and ENCODER_B.\n\n\nSpeed Logic\n\nMotor speed in revolutions per second (rev/sec) was calculated by RPS = counter / (PPR * 4) where counter represents the number of pulses in 1 second and PPR = 408 is the known pulse per revolution rate provided in the motor datasheet. In this equation, PPR is scaled by 4 to account for the four flags raised per revolution by the rising and falling edge of ENCODER_A and rising and falling edge of ENCODER_B.\n\n\nMoreover, measured speed was verified by the calculations shown below in Figure 4 for a 12V input. Importantly, the frequency in Figure 4 is read straight from the oscilloscope, so it has already accounted for the four encoder edges, therefore dividing by 4 is ommitted from the RPS calculation.\n\n Figure 4: Verifying motor speed by comparing to the theoretical speed listed in the datasheet for 12V.\n\nSince the measured speed of 2.917 rev/sec at 12V is very close to the theoretical speed of 2.5 rev/sec at 12V, the measured speed matches the true motor speed. The slight variation between the measured and theoretical speeds could be a result of the motor speed itself fluctuating or the analog power supply dial being set slightly past the 12V mark internally.\n\n\n\nSchematic\n\nThe schematic for this lab was straightforward and can be viewed below in Figure 5.\n\n Figure 5: Electrical schematic for the lab consisting of the MCU, brushed motor, and power supply."

    "section": "Polling vs. Interrupting",
    "text": "Polling vs. Interrupting\n\nIn order to monitor whether the two encoder signals are HIGH or LOW at a given time, they must continuously read by the MCU. One way to achieve this is through polling—a method where the main loop constantly cheks if the GPIO pins connected to the encoder outputs have changed. The issue with polling, however, is that everything inside the main while loop takes time to execute. As a result, if the processor is occupied with other operations, it may fail to detect a rapid change in the encoder signal. In other words, polling can lead to inaccurate, aliasing behavior. To address this limitation, interrupts are used. Interrupts enables the microcontroller to immediately respond to specific events, such as a change in input state, without waiting for the main loop to complete.\n\n\nThe oscilloscope trace in Figure 6 shows the following signals: Yellow = ENCODER_B, Blue = POLLING_PIN, and Pink = INTERRUPT_PIN for a high speed set by 20V. At this fast motor speed, the trace shows that the polling signal frequency is too large to accurately sample the encoder, whereas the interrupt signal can effectively sample the encoder. According to the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theory, since the interrupt signal frequency of 3.85kHz is greater than double the maximum frequency of the encoder signal which is 1.85kHz, the interrupt signal can accurately read all encoder changes. This shows how applying interrupts instead of polling leads to more accurate encoder readings over a wide range of motor speeds.\n\n Figure 6: Oscilloscope trace showing Yellow = ENCODER_B where Blue = POLLING_PIN aliases and Pink = INTERRUPT_PIN samples correctly."

Moreover, all edges of the encoder pulses were used to achieve the highest resolution measurement. Lastly, the MCU did not miss any pulses at high speed and properly output a non-zero velocity at very low speeds."

The following prompt was entered to ChatGPT 5.0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLLM Prompt\n\n\n\nWrite me interrupt handlers to interface with a quadrature encoder. I’m using the STM32L432KC, what pins should I connect the encoder to in order to allow it to easily trigger the interrupts?\n\n\n\nWhile ChatGPT 5.0 was able to produce a response quickly, the code did not compile immediately because it contained lines that we not not spelled the same or did not exist in the libraries I used. For example, I did not have a \"stm32l4xx_hal.h\" header file. After I replaced this with &lt;stm32l432xx.h&gt;, the code compiled and ran. However, the printed output was incorrect. The magnitude of velocity was always near 0.000 and the direction was constantly CW. ChatGPT may be more helpful if it is familar with your libraries."

Leading up to the break, I had been super busy with midterms and projects and hadn’t gotten out much. I told myself I would do 3-5 miles at a 10 minute pace to ease in, but once I got started I couldn’t stop. At mile 5 averaging 9:40min/mi I started to feel the runner’s high and thought: It’d be fun to finish sub-9… In the last two miles, I ran a 7:52 and 6:50 pace to barely clear 9min/mi! It was absolutely awesome to push myself beyond what I thought I could do. I came back home to some watermelon and felt amazing having started the day off with a BIG WIN.\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 1, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Is Fuel  One of my favorite parts of the Hoch (Harvey Mudd’s dinning hall) is the wide range of food options. I feel like there is always something both tasty and healthy to available. Depending on the day, the kitchen is always stocked with a variety foods from different cultures too: pho, sushi, steak, quesobirria tacos, curry, bao buns, salmon, pasta, and spring rolls. One of my daily goals is to make my plate as colorful as possible. Here, I picked out some grilled chicken, mediterranean meatball, and a medley of veggies. This meal helped me stay full and be able to concentrate for the rest of the day. Looking forward to dinner!\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 27, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE4 Hammer Kick-Off  As a 3rd year upperclassmen student, this year I’ve enjoyed transitioning into more leadership roles on campus. One key shift for me has been with my job as a Machine Shop Proctor. With a full year of proctoring under my belt, I’ve truly become both knowledgeable and comfortable guiding new users in the shop. With E4 hammer season starting this week, I’ve taught several groups of up to 6 students at a time. Although the environment is both loud and busy, I project my voice and engage students through participation so that each and every one of them knows that the shop is a welcoming space that they can be a part of.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 15, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom Board Game Pieces  This week, I’ve gotten really excited about 3D printing. It started with printing prototypes for my Harvey Mudd College Clinic Project, but now I can’t stop! What better way to use my design and priting skills than to modify one of my favorite family domino games: Mexican Train. To enhance the game, I designed and printed trains in my family member’s favorite colors and have raised the height of the plastic centering ring or “train station” piece to better secure dominoes in place. Going forward, I hope to design my own Tangram pieces and puzzle cubes. Being able to print my designs quickly and for free through our Makerspace is so cool and I’m super grateful!\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 10, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOracle Stock Surge - Bloomberg This morning, Oracle (ORCL) had one of the most explosive single-day gains in market history with shares soaring 36%. The company announced several multi-billion-dollar AI cloud contracts, including a $300-billion deal with OpenAI over 5 years. Today single handedly brought Oracle’s valuation to over $900 million, making CEO Larry Ellison $100 billion richer and the wealthiest person in the world. $100 billion is an unimaginable amount of money, and to be acquired in a single day blows my mind. Oracle has definitively claimed their stake in the upward AI movement and we’ll see if their momentum continues."
