    __Fall Break!__ <br>
      Today was officially the first day of Fall Break and I got to start it with a run to the beach! Leading up to the break, 
      I had been super busy with midterms and projects and hadn't gotten out much. I told myself I would do 3-5 miles at a 10 
      minute pace to ease in, but once I got started I couldn't stop. At mile 5 averaging 9:40min/mi I started to feel the 
      runner's high and thought: It'd be fun to finish sub-9... In the last two miles, I ran a 7:52 and 6:50 pace to barely clear
      9min/mi! It was absolutely awesome to push myself beyond what I thought I could do. I came back home to some watermelon and
      felt amazing having started the day off with a BIG WIN.

    __Food Is Fuel__ <br>
      One of my favorite parts of the Hoch (Harvey Mudd's dinning hall) is the wide range of food options. I feel like there is always
      something both tasty and healthy to available. Depending on the day, the kitchen is always stocked with a variety foods from different
      cultures too: pho, sushi, steak, quesobirria tacos, curry, bao buns, salmon, pasta, and spring rolls. One of my daily goals is to
      make my plate as colorful as possible. Here, I picked out some grilled chicken, mediterranean meatball, and a medley of veggies. This
      meal helped me stay full and be able to concentrate for the rest of the day. Looking forward to dinner!

    __E4 Hammer Kick-Off__ <br>
      As a 3rd year upperclassmen student, this year I've enjoyed transitioning into more leadership roles on campus. One key shift for me
      has been with my job as a Machine Shop Proctor. With a full year of proctoring under my belt, I've truly become both knowledgeable and 
      comfortable guiding new users in the shop. With E4 hammer season starting this week, I've taught several groups of up to 6 students at a 
      time. Although the environment is both loud and busy, I project my voice and engage students through participation so that each and every 
      one of them knows that the shop is a welcoming space that they can be a part of.

    __Custom Board Game Pieces__ <br>
      This week, I've gotten really excited about 3D printing. It started with printing prototypes for my Harvey Mudd College Clinic Project,
      but now I can't put it down! What better way to use my design and priting skills than to modify one of my family-favorite domino games: 
      [*Mexican Train*](https://www.jaqueslondon.co.uk/products/mexican-train-dominoes). To enhance the game, I designed and printed trains in my
      family member's favorite colors and have raised the height of the plastic centering ring or "train station" piece to better secure dominoes in place. 
      Going forward, I hope to design my own [Tangram](https://www.amazon.com/Tangram-Geometry-Silhouette-Tangrams-Challenge/dp/B005IDO63Q) 
      pieces and puzzle cubes. Being able to print my designs quickly and for free through our [Makerspace](https://www.hmc.edu/makerspace/)
      is so cool and I'm super grateful!

    [__Oracle Stock Surge - *Bloomberg*__](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-10/oracle-co-founder-larry-ellison-closes-in-on-elon-musk-as-world-s-richest-man)<br>
      This morning, Oracle (ORCL) had one of the most explosive single-day gains in market history with shares soaring 36%. The company 
      announced several multi-billion-dollar AI cloud contracts, including a $300-billion deal with OpenAI over 5 years. Today single 
      handedly brought Oracle's valuation to over $900 million, making CEO Larry Ellison $100 billion richer and the wealthiest person 
      in the world. $100 billion is an unimaginable amount of money, and to be acquired in a single day blows my mind. Oracle has 
      definitively claimed their stake in the upward AI movement and we'll see if their momentum continues.
