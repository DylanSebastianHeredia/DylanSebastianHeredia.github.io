## Welcome To My Online Portfolio!

Hello! My name is Sebastian (He/Him) and I’m a Sophomore Engineering 
major at [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.hmc.edu) in Claremont, CA. I am passionate about electronics 
and manufacturing, and hope to leverage these fields to make a positive impact on 
the world. To make my goals a reality, I seek hands-on, professional experience in 
technical engineering projects. 

As an engineer, machinist, and tutor I’ve gained technical skills in CAD and computer 
programming, design and manufacturing, and teaching that I’m excited to apply to helping 
communities all over. I love challenging myself to not only learn, but master new skills. 
I hope to combine skills in new and unique ways to make novel creations that help people.
