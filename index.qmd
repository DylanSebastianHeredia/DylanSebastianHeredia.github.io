<p class="justified-indent"> 
    Hello! My name is Sebastian and I’m a Junior at [Harvey Mudd College](https://www.hmc.edu) majoring in Engineering, with a strong foundation in math and a growing 
    interest in electrical engineering—especially as it connects to embedded systems, robotics, and automation. 
    I’m passionate about working at the intersection of hardware and systems that sense, respond, and interact 
    in the world. I thrive in hands-on, fast paced environments and seek technical opportunities that will allow 
    me to deepen my engineering skills and contribute to meaningful, systems-driven projects.
</p>

<p class="justified-indent"> 
    Outside of engineering, I’m drawn to visual and audio storytelling in the form of photography, sketching, and editing 
    sound and video. These hobbies sharpen my attention to detail, structure, and rhythm, which contribute to 
    how I approach engineering problems. Whether I’m designing an electrical system, writing embedded code, or building a website—like 
    the one I created here using [Quarto x GitHub](https://github.com/DylanSebastianHeredia/DylanSebastianHeredia.github.io)—I 
    focus on how components work together and how the system behaves as a whole. This perspective allows me to prototype 
    efficiently, communicate ideas clearly, and approach challenges both methodically and creatively.
